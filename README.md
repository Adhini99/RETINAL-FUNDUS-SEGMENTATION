# RETINAL-FUNDUS-SEGMENTATION

Retinal Vessel Segmentation with Bi-Level Class Balancing

1. Enhanced Preprocessing: Apply GCN, CLAHE, and gamma correction to improve vessel visibility.

2. Bi-Level Balancing: Address both vessel/non-vessel and thick/thin vessel imbalances using patch-level class control. 

3. CNN Architecture & Evaluation: Train on DRIVE dataset and evaluate segmentation accuracy with AUC, sensitivity, andÂ specificity.
